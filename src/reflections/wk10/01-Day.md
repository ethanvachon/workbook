## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

The three different data types in C# are Value, Reference, and Pointer. They all differ in the ways that they all store data.

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

The Value data type is different from the others because they hold the data value in their own memory space. The data that it stores can't be changed in other methods, as it creates another copy of it when it gets passed as a parameter.

## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

A Reference type doesn't directly store the data it is assigned, instead its memory space has a kind of address for where to find the actual data. This is different from the Value types, because there is an extra step to get to the actual value.
