## What is a list in C#?

A list is just a 'list' of data of the same type, similar to an array in javascript, but a list in c# cannot be iterated over. A c# array also exists, but is different enough from a list to be its own thing.

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

.Find definitely seems like the most useful method, and is also the one we've used the most so far especially for get one requests and puts. .Remove and .Contains also seem really useful for delete requests, and checking if something already exists.

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

Well the most simple way to do it would to just use a .Find method and search through the list with an id. You could then assign this to a variable to use for whatever is needed.
