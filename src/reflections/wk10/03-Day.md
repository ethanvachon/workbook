## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are just a list of constant predefined data points that you can map other data on to. For instance, the example listed illustrates how 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 can be mapped to North, South, East, and West. We actually used these in our capstone to map 0-6 to days of the week.

## How can you modify an Enum?

In the declaration of an Enum, you can change the base type, the members, as well as what number they correlate to. If you wanted, for example, to change the enum from a 0 based index and instead have it start at one, this would be done by setting the first member to one manually.

## How have you used Enum in your afternoon lab projects thus far?

We've used IEnumerable when we return more than one object from a crud request. Besides the enum we used in our capstone, I haven't had a use case for an enum in our afternoon projects.
