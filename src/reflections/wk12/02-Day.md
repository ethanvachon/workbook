# Final Day Two

This morning, I had the project essentially done except for a few small things like finishing up the vault page and implementing the masonry layout. The vault page I got done pretty quick, but the masonry layout was a rough setup. I did end up getting it working and graded by the end of the day. The rest of the week I'll be working on styling and career homework. I'd also like to look into creating postman tests as well.
