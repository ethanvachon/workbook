# Final Day One

Today, I'll be working on the front end logic, getting back into .vue files. Over the weekend, I completed the server and the services on the front end. I'm really glad I got that done because there is no shortage of things for me to get done this week. I'm going to try to get my final graded by tuesday, but I'm a bit worried about running into a stubborn bug towards the end but I'm hoping for the best.
