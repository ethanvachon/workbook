# Final Day Three

Today I'm just working on some styling and finishing up some final things for the project. It's all graded and I passed, but I do want to make it a good portfolio piece for the future. Css isn't my strong point but making an application look good is crucial if you want to show it off. No amount of c# will make an application impressive to someone who isn't super familiar with code.
