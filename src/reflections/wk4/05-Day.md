## Week Four Conclusion 

This week was a really good week, as I enjoyed the material we learned and put in a lot of out of class time to solidify everything we learned. Last week was a little rough, as the material was a big change from everything we learned before that. This week, in contrast, felt like a much more natural extension of what we've learned thus far. It also opens up quite a few possibilities for fun and more useful projects I can build in my own time.
