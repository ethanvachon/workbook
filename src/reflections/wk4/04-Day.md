## What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It's simply a design pattern/architecture for an API.

## What does Stateless mean?
If an API is stateless, the server doesn't store information about the user of the API. Every request sent has all the information needed for the server, and it will return a response no matter what other requests are sent by a user.

## What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
