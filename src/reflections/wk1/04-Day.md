## What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Wire-framing allows you to get a rough idea what a website will look like before the final version is created. You can start on the final product without having to figure out the structure and style as you go. This speeds up the process and gives you a much more polished and thought out website. Additionally, planning it out beforehand ensures the layout is user-focused, rather than decided by what is easiest for the developer.

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

The 3 different types of wire-frames are low-fidelity, medium-fidelity, and high-fidelity with low being the most basic and high having the most amount of detail. For a small personal project, the simplicity of a low-fidelity wire-frame has the advantage of being quick and easy to make while still allowing you to gain the advantages of planning the layout ahead of time. High-fidelity wire-frames are generally created as a final rough draft, using less filler text and images it makes creating the final draft much easier. 


## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Wire-frames are worth making because creating the layout and styling of a website as you go will never end up as polished as it would be if a wire-frame was created beforehand. Even a low-fidelity example is massively beneficial as well as easy and quick to create.
