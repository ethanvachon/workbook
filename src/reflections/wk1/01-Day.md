## In your own words, why do we use Git?
Git is a useful tool to view a coding project, specifically how it changes over time. It tracks these changes to allow you to view different versions of a project and track when and how different functionalities have changed. These features are incredibly important especially for larger projects with many different moving parts.

## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
Creating a branch from a project gives a developer freedom to experiment in a separate instance of the project without affecting the main branch. This is something that is beneficial because if things get too buggy or the changes are ultimately decided to be undesirable, nothing has been lost except for time. 

## What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the program that keeps track of changes in code locally when changes have been committed, while GitHub stores repositories of code on their website. When committed, GitHub does not update the repository on the website, it doesn't change until you synchronize it with the changes stored by git locally.
