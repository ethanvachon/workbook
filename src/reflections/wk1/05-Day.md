# Week One conclusion
During week one I learned more than I did in a month of coding on my own. Previously I didn't know how to use bootstrap at all and was somewhat confident about CSS in general. This week has made me a lot more proficient with website building, though the week wasn't without struggle. I initially struggled quite a bit with bootstrap and random elements extending outside the containers, making the page scroll horizontally. Now, after completion of the checkpoint for week one, I feel much more comfortable avoiding this issue.
