**3.** What is the `\<html>\</html>` tag in a document?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

CSS stands for cascading style sheets.

**6.** What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:
```css
 h1.main-title {
   color : rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
 }
```

The last tag used for making lists is the description list tag (dl). It is a list of terms, all with definitions provided.
