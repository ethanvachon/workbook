# Day Three Reflection
__12-2-20__

## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
Never have the background color as the default white. When I change websites from the default color to a light blue, or another almost-white color it looks infinitely better. The main lesson from this is to not use any "harsh" colors. 

## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

sansfrancis.co is helpful because it provides an extensive list of different tools to assist you in the designing process. The W3.CSS templates have a lot of clean and modern designs that are great for finding inspiration, even if you don't actually use the template itself. My favorite resource is the cheating at design article provided in the codeworks student resources. It has a lot of good advice to make designing a polished looking website easier, especially if you don't already have an eye for design.  It also included my favorite design tip that I explained in question 1.


## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
I believe that good design can influence people because it can convey the message that the company or person who owns the website is professional and polished. If a user visits a poorly designed website it reflects very badly on the owner and they are much less to trust the website or the products being sold.
