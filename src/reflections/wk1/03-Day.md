# Day Three Reflection
__12-2-20__

## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
Never have the background color as the default white. When I change websites from the default color to a light blue, or another almost-white color it looks infinitely better. The main lesson from this is to not use any "harsh" colors. 

## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.


## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
I believe that good design can influence people because it can convey the message that the company or person who owns the website is professional and polished. If a user visits a poorly designed website it reflects very badly on the owner and they are much less to trust the website or the products being sold.
