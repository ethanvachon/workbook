## What is the purpose of a query string? 
A query string allows to to pass data into your server code. You can do many things with this data like searching through a database more specifically 

## What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next? 
Every query parameter starts with a question mark followed by the body of the query. If you want to add more, simply add a & between each of them.


## When do you think query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
It can be very useful for finding specific items in a database. It essentially acts as a filter for your data.
