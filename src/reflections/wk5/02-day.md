# Day Two Reflection
__1/12/21__

## What are the three types of relationships?
The first one not super common, but it is one-to-one. The other two are one-to-many and many-to-many, with one to many being generally the most common.

## What are the benefits of the traditional linking method of relationships instead of embedding?
When deleting or updating an item, you won't have to find everywhere it is embedded. Additionally a document may exceed the maximum document size when embedding.


## What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
You have to determine essentially what method will have the least amount of potential problems. With this, you must find out which data models will have connections to other data models.
