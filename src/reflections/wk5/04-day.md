## What is a virtual property?
A virtual property is an additional piece of data for a given model. It can be set manually or automatically, but we've had them be set automatically in our projects for the most part.

## When might you use a virtual property?
You can use them to generate other properties you don't need to manually pass in on a post request. You can also use virtual properties as getters and setters for themselves. 

## How do you search by a virtual properties value? 
Virtual properties cannot be used with queries and field selection, because in the database they're only stored as logic. They aren't just static model properties, they work as functions on the model.
