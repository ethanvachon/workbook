# Day Four Reflection
__12-17-20__

## What problems does the Observer pattern seek to solve?
It moves the draw functions to the controller in the form of event listeners. These event listeners are easy to implement because they only require one line of code to be set up and easily trigger draw functions when data in the Proxy State is changed. This means these changes don't have to be stored in the service, so the files are more balanced and organized.

## What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?



## Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
