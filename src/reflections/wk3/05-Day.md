# Week Three Conclusion 
This was definitely the hardest week of the camp so far. It seems like a huge jump from last week, as we went from a single js file with no classes to working almost entirely with classes and in many different files with different responsibilities. It was hard to initially adjust and on tuesday especially I was struggling with the concepts quite a bit. Now though, at the end of the week on friday, I am much more comfortable with the new system and I'm looking forward to expanding upon this and building even more practical applications when everyone is back in class after christmas break.
