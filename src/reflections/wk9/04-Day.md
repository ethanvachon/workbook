## What is an SSL certificate?

SSL certificates encrypt data moving between a server and a browser for added security for private information. They are essentially just small data files.

## What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

Certificates are split into two main categories, encryption and validation, and domain number. The first is defined by the level of encryption and how it validates. The second is defined by how many domains can use the certificates.

## What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

SSL certificates provide an extra layer of security for websites. If an application takes sensitive data from a user, this certificate system is absolutely needed.
