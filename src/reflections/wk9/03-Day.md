# Day Three Reflection

**2/10/21**

## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

The amount of meetings can be reduced in favor of more time to code. A smaller team will need to have fewer people coordinated and on the same page for things to run smoothly.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

It is generally better to focus on one thing at a time. It is much easier to coordinate everyone when there's only one central goal.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

The three points in the unattainable triangle are fast, cheap, and good. It reminds you to focus on what you can and keep the tradeoff in mind.
