# Day One Reflection

**2/8/21**

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

For the basic architecture, we're using Vue 3 for the front end and Node.js and MongoDb for the back. We'll also including sweetalerts, auth0, socket.io, and we'll be calling to an api for background images.

## What went well so far?

The basic planning of the project went very well. We had to change projects completely and quickly found a better idea that we all compromised on without losing interest in the project. We also successfully created a figma, trello board, and we planned out the basic architecture for our data.

## What would you do differently? Why?

I had some problems with the first idea we had that I should've voiced sooner, we may have pivoted faster and had more time to plan our project. Also, we should've thought our the back end more before we started, our plan for it was missing a decent amount.
