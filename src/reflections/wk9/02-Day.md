## What is a Github action and how do they work?

A github action is essentially a specific 'action' that takes place based on an event. This event can be when somebody stars a repo or if a commits something. These are set in a text file.

## What benefits do Github actions provide?

They allow you to do specific tasks with a repository whenever you want. There is a variety of different triggers that you can use in many different contexts.

## What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

The different types of trigger actions are workflow, scheduled, webhooks, and external. Something like a push or pull are workflows, while something like a star on a repo would be a webhook.
