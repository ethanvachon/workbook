## What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Pair programming is a practice in which two people work on the same code with only one person doing the typing. The person typing is the 'driver' and the other is the navigator. The navigator's job is to focus more on the big picture and the direction of development.

## What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
There are many benefits of using partner programming, with the most obvious being a heightened quality of the code because it leads to much cleaner and more articulate implementations of code. It additionally leads to a much more even spread of knowledge across the dev team, and there are less interruptions to the coding process.

## What are some drawbacks of Pair Programming?
The cost of hiring two devs rather than one is an obvious drawback to pair programming. This however, isn't extremely impactful, as the increased quality of code means maintenance is much easier to the future.
