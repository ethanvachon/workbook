## What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a user experience?
A user experience is essentially every interaction a user has with your business. The biggest thing to consider for creating a good UX is how a user feels about the experience they have while interacting with a business.

## What are some benefits of taking into account the User experience?
Having a good UX provides many benefits to both the user and the business. The customer has an easy and minimally confusing time doing what they want to do and they are more likely to interact with a business again.

## Why is the User Experience important?
The user experience is the most important thing to consider when designing software, a website for example can have a visually impressive design but if it's confusing, a customer is much less likely to come back. The goal of the design process should be to make it as easy as possible to use.
