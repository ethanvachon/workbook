## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
Code documentation is essentially an explanation for the code you've written, for example how a function works and what kind of parameters need to be passed in. The main ways of providing code documentation are with a readme on the repo,or with actual code documentation in the source.

## What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
Code documentation allows others to easily understand your code, it also helps you understand your own code if you have to come back to it at a later time. It makes your code infinitely more readable.

## How important is Code Documentation and why?
Code documentation is extremely important for code that you or someone else have to come back to in the future. Providing documentation makes code easier to maintain for anyone that isn't super familiar with the code to begin with.
