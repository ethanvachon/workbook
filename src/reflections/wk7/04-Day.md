# Day Four Reflection
__1/28/21__

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
Pair programming and 'coding out loud' helped us a great deal especially when we were trying to implement sockets. It helped both of us understand the entire process much better. We also did our best to create the best possible UX.

## What went well?
The initial setup of the project went very smooth and gave us plenty of time to work on stretch goals. We also didn't have any bugs that we couldn't figure out without too much trouble.

## What would you do differently?
We got distracted a good amount from the task at hand with less important things. We may have focused a bit too much on the UX and other stretch goals before finishing the core functionality of the application.
