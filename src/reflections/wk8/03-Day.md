## What is software development testing?

Testing is essentially the practice of writing code that verifies that existing code is functioning as expected. Testing is a must when creating an application, especially to test code without interacting with it on localhost.

## What are the benefits of testing in software development?

Testing can let you make sure code is working without testing the entire application to make sure a function works. It's a much more efficient method.

## What are some potential drawbacks of testing in software development?

In some cases, a test can be run with a simple console.log or a check of the vue dev tools. In some cases, writing a test can be a bad use of time.
