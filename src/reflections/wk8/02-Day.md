# Day Two Reflection

## Why is communication on a small team important?

Communication in any team will increase the efficiency of that team. Everyone needs to know what they should be working on, what that code relies on, and what everyone else is doing to avoid conflicts. Without effective communication, a team would be crippled.

## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

The amount of meetings can be reduced in favor of more time to code. A smaller team will need to have fewer people coordinated and on the same page for things to run smoothly.

## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

The three points in the unattainable triangle are fast, cheap, and good. A Good project that comes fast won't be cheap, but a good project for cheap won't be fast. Additionally, a fast and cheap project won't be good.
