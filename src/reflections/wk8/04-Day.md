## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing is testing a small piece of the project, while component testing tests a much larger piece of the application. End to end testing is a test of the functionality of the entire thing.

## What testing method do you think is most useful? Why?

The most useful testing method, in my opinion, is unit testing. It is the most common and simple test that you can use often to verify small pieces of code.

## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I think the least useful method is end to end. You'll usually only need to do this once or twice on a project, since it needs all components of an app.
