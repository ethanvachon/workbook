## What is a nested route?
Nested routes allow you to create much more complex routing systems for an application. It gives you the ability to have components nestled in other components.

## When might you use a nested route?
A nested route could be used when a page has multiple other pages linked on it that can only be reached through the parent page. For example, you could make a separate page for each data point used in the parent page.

## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
Yes, you can attach parameters onto a route that can be accessed by the page that the route directs to. You can access this information on the child page by using the .useRoute() method.
