## What is component based architecture?
Component based architecture divides different functionalities of a webpage and gives them all a unique file. There are many components that coexist on a page but they all act completely independently. 

## What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
It clean up your code, especially compared to a mvs pattern. Every part of the functionality is separate from other components in CBA. Components are also reuseable while still maintaining independence. 

## What are some drawbacks of Component based architecture?
You can get carried await with CBA, and end up with code that is less readable than it would be in an mvc pattern. The possibility of over-engineering is always there when using CBA.
