## What are lifecycle hooks?
Lifecycle hooks are methods that you can use to access data during different parts of a component's lifecycle. They are used in the script tag and are triggered by a specific stage in the lifecycle being reached.

## What are lifecycle hooks used for? 
Lifecycle hooks are used to access/change data at a specific time. A perfect example is the onMounted hook that triggers when the component is first mounted, this can be used to get data that the component needs as soon as it mounts.

## What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
Mounting hooks allow you to access a component right before and after its first render. This is useful for accessing/modifying the component's DOM directly before or after it is first rendered.
