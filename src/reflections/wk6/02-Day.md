# Day Two Reflection
__1/19/21__

## What are props? 
Props are how information is passed between different components. It works in a similar way to passing an argument into a function. 

## What are props used for? 
Props are used to pass data from a parent element into a child element. For example, if you had a separate component to display an image, you would need to pass a prop containing the image url. This is shown in the daily project for today.

## Where can props be used or accessed?
Props can only be passed from parent components to their child components. When a child component has a prop passed into it, it has no way to edit it. It can only view the data it received.
