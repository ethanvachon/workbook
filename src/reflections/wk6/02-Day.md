## What are props? 
Props are how information is passed between different components. It works in a similar way to passing an argument into a function. 

## What are props used for? 


## Where can props be used or accessed?
Props can only be passed from parent components to their child components. When a child component has a prop passed into it, it has no way to edit it. It can only view the data it received.
