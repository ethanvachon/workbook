## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
The main way to write to the console is with console.log() in javascript. This is useful because you can log different things to the console to ensure variables are receiving the intended value. You can also directly type into the console to call functions or change values of variables. Lastly, the console is where error messages will be displayed which is invaluable for debugging your code.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The elements tag shows your html and the css rules applied to whatever is selected. This tab is very useful for debugging html especially because it allows you to edit your html and instantly see the results. Additionally, this new code will go away when the page is refreshed, so it allows you to test different things without affecting your actual code.

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
I've recently stopped using console.log as much for debugging, as using the chrome debugger is much easier. Typing debugger into javascript will stop the code when it is reached, where you can then go through every step of the code and see everything that it is doing.
