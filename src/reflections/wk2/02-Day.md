## What are the three ways to syntactically write a function. What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
The three ways to write functions are Function Declarations, Function Expressions, and Arrow Function Expression. The difference in how they act is that Function declarations are hoisted, while Function expressions are not hoisted, can be declared without a name and set equal to a variable. Arrow Function Expression is a shorter syntax for writing functions but they do not create their own "this" value.

## What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameters are created when a function is written as a placeholder so information can be passed into the function when it is called, in the place of the parameters. An argument is the actual information that is passed into the function from the parameters.

## What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
