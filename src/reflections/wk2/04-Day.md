# Day Four Reflection

## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write code?
This is important in the same ways a wireframe for html formatting is.

I know I could've avoided many problems in previous projects if I had planned my code out ahead of time.

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?
Stack overflow is great for solutions to specific bugs, while MDN is great for finding the syntax of different methods. I probably use w3 the most, as they have a lot of more easy to understand information about almost anything I need. I tend to avoid Stack overflow, as just taking another persons solution doesn't give me the opportunity to learn how to solve these problems on my own.

You can create code that is extremely readable but is extremely inefficient. A balance between these two things is imperative.
