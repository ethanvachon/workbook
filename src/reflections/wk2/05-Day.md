# Week Two Conclusion 
This week was finally the week of javascript, and while it was somewhat confusing, I had a lot of fun with it. I enjoyed working with HTML/CSS as well but I don't have an eye for design and I find the tedious formatting and padding adjustments not as enjoyable as writing Javascript. Every project of this week is something I want to keep working on, and I suspect during Christmas Break I'll be returning to all the afternoon projects that were prematurely abandoned for time. Every time I finished a function, I had five more ideas for other things I wanted to implement. The checkpoint for this week is especially exciting, building a functioning game is extremely rewarding to me, compared with the static site clone of last week.
